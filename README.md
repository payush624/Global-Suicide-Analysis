### Findings
     1. More than 200 000 people died due to suicide every year between 1985-2016.
     2. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 35-54 year olds. 
     3. Suicide is often thought of as a gender-neutral issue, but in reality, itâ€™s a problem that affects men far more than women. Three times as many men kill 
        themselves every year than women do, that means more men are dying from suicide than car accident
     4. We can see that high GDP per capita does not immediately translate to a higher happiness index and less suicide cases. This tells us that it is certain that 
        the richer is not necessarily the happiest. Therefore, besides income, there must be other important factors that leds people to take this step, but from 
        above analysis it can be concluded that country with lesser population and higher GDP per capita has less suicide cases.
